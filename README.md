# Duck-Hunt-Scratch-Project
This project came about as part of my curriculum for Harvard's CS50x class.

## Scope
For those who have not taken Harvard CS50x course, the class is geared as an introduction to the world of programming. With that in mind, the first intro project they assign is to create a program within the beginner friendly programming language "Scratch".
This language allows for an easy visual representation of coding to get those who have never coded an easy and visual way to learn to code.
As such, for this project I decided to limit the scope of this recreation in the following way:

- Rounds will be limited to 5. In the real game, the round are continuous with the number of birds and speed increasing in higher rounds.
- Dynamic spawning will not be enabled.
- Score count will be limited to Scratch's speak function as, quite honestly, changing costumes for all the point values would be tedious and is more than I care to do for an intro project.

## Gameplay
The game will consist of 5 rounds. At least 7 birds must be eliminated in order to proceed to the next level. The player is allowed 3 shots before reloading and must eliminate the birds before it flies off screen.
